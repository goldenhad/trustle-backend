Evol 
---------------------------------------

This documentation has been automatically generated via `pdoc`.

Evol is a library that helps you make evolutionary algorithms. 

If you're looking at the library for the first time we recommend
that you first take a look at the examples in the /examples folder
on github. It is usually a better starting point to get started. 

Any details can be discovered on the docs. We hope that this 
library makes it fun to write heuristics again.
